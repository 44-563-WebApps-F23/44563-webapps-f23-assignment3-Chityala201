    <h4> Favorite Food - Fish </h4>
    <p>
        I like to eat fish because it is tasty and healthy, and I enjoy it in various forms, including fish fry, fish
        curry and fish pickle.
        As mentioned earlier, fish is a nutritious source of protein, omega-3 fatty acids, vitamins, and minerals.
        Consuming fish can contribute to a well-balanced and healthy diet, supporting various aspects of your health,
        including heart health and brain function.
